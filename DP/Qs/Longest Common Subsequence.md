    // File path already exists → show link
    dv.el("a", "Link", { href: linkPrefix + frontmatter?.solution_file });
} else {
    // No file path yet → show Add button
    const btn = dv.el("button", "Add solution file");

    btn.onclick = async () => {

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return *the length of their longest **common subsequence**.* If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
* `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

**Starter Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string s1, string s2) {
        // code here
    }
};
```
